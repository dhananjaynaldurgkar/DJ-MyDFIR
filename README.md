[Brief Introduction]

[BRIEF INTRODUCTION]
I'm a cybersecurity specialist, consultant, and certified trainer with nearly two decades of experience in protecting digital infrastructure and helping others build successful careers in cybersecurity.

My journey started as a field engineer managing Windows/Linux servers, routers, and switches, and has evolved into a career focused on enterprise security, digital risk, and mentorship. I’ve built deep expertise in system and network administration, virtualization, datacenter operations, and overall cyber defense strategy.

I hold several industry certifications including CISSP, CISM, PMP, CEH, Security+, ITIL, and ISO Lead Auditor, which allow me to design and deliver secure, compliant, and scalable solutions for modern organizations.

## Objective
As the founder of CybersecurityCareer.Academy, I’ve had the privilege of training over 15,000 students in more than 160 countries. What drives me most is the feedback and appreciation I receive from my students—they often tell me how much they value me as a mentor, and that motivates me to give even more. Their success fuels my passion and reaffirms my commitment to helping others grow in this field.

In addition to training and consulting, I enjoy writing and speaking on topics like cybersecurity leadership, digital transformation, and the evolving tech landscape.

If you're looking to learn, collaborate, or explore opportunities in cybersecurity, I’m always open to connecting.

I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.
